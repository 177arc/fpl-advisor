    "# Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to help with the selection of team members for the [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) (FPL) by attempting to forecast how many points players will earn. It accesses the FPL API to download up-to-date stats, provides visual analysis and uses linear optimisation to recommend a team with the maximum expected points to improve the performance of your current team.\n",

    "If you are not familar with the Fantasy Permier League, you can watch this introduction:\n",

For validation, we calculate the actual points of the players of the optimised team. We also calculate the points of the dream team, i.e. the total points of the team with highest actual points for each game week."
