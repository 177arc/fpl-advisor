    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to help with the selection of team members for the [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) (FPL) by attempting to forecast how many points players will earn. It accesses the FPL API to download up-to-date stats, provides visual analysis and uses linear optimisation to recommend a team with the maximum expected points to improve the performance of your current team.\n",

It uses match event data to generate a single score for three key areas – Influence, Creativity and Threat. These figures then combine to create an individual’s ICT Index score. It condenses more than 40 match event statistics into four distinct scores. These offer a view on player performance for factors that are known to produce FPL points.
