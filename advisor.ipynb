    "# Purpose\n",
    "The purpose of this Jupyter notebook is to help with the selection of team members for the [Fantasy Premier League](https://fantasy.premierleague.com/) (FPL) by forecasting how many points players will earn. It uses the [fpl-data](https://github.com/177arc/fpl-data) generated estimate points and other stats. It provides:\n",
    "- a visual tool for analysing the performance of each player and understanding their potential to earn points\n",
    "- a optimiser to recommend a team with the maximum expected points to improve the performance of your current team\n",
    "- tools for selecting the best game weeks play your chips\n",
    "- visual tools to understand the re-liability of the data\n",
